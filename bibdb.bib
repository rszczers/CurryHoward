abstract = "A definition of simultaneous substitution for the lambda calculus is presented that is easier to work with than standard single substitution because it is a definition by structural recursion, instead of recursion on the length of terms, and bound variables are always renamed. As a result, many proofs involving substitution are by structural induction, instead of induction on the length of terms, and are simpler than the corresponding standard proofs because of the reduction in the number of cases that must be considered. Furthermore, because of the uniform renaming of bound variables, identity substitutions normalize terms with respect to equivalence up to the renaming of bound variables (α-congruence), allowing induction-free proofs of some theorems that ordinarily would be proved by induction on the relation of α-congruence. A series of results relating simultaneous substitution and α-congruence are proved, and a simple proof of the “substitution lemma” of denotational semantics is given."

title = "Typability and type checking in system F are equivalent and undecidable",
abstract = "Girard and Reynolds independently invented System F (a.k.a. the second-order polymorphically typed lambda calculus) to handle problems in logic and computer programming language design, respectively. Viewing F in the Curry style, which associates types with untyped lambda terms, raises the questions of typability and type checking. Typability asks for a term whether there exists some type it can be given. Type checking asks, for a particular term and type, whether the term can be given that type. The decidability of these problems has been settled for restrictions and extensions of F and related systems and complexity lower-bounds have been determined for typability in F, but this report is the first to resolve whether these problems are decidable for System F. This report proves that type checking in F is undecidable, by a reduction from semi-unification, and that typability in F is undecidable, by a reduction from type checking. Because there is an easy reduction from typability to type checking, the two problems are equivalent. The reduction from type checking to typability uses a novel method of constructing lambda terms that simulate arbitrarily chosen type environments. All of the results also hold for the ?I-calculus. {\circledC} 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Firstly, we give a general discussion of the design issues involved in implementing non-strict functional languages.^M
Next, we present the STG language, an austere but recognisably-functional language, which as well as a denotational meaning has a well-defined operational semantics. The STG language is the \abstract machine code" for the Spineless Tagless G-machine.^M
Lastly, we discuss the mapping of the STG language onto stock hardware. The success of an abstract machine model depends largely on how efficient this mapping can be made, though this topic is often relegated to a short section. Instead, we give a detailed discussion of the design issues and the choices we have made. Our principal target is the C language, treating the C compiler as a portable assembler.},
